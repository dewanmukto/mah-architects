    <p><b>About</b></p>
    <p><b>MAH Architects Inc.</b>, previously known as A&A, was established in 2018 in Ontario, 
Canada. The firm has completed numerous projects and offers architectural services for 
various building types, including residential, commercial, retail, industrial, institutional, 
restaurant and café, healthcare, and hospitality facilities such as hotels and motels.</p>
    <p><b>Why Your Project Requires Architects ?</b></p>
    <p>The Architect, who functions as advisor, coordinator, and technical manager, in 
addition to being a creative artist, can design and administer a contract that 
ensures a project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the required 
standards of quality.</p>
    <p>According to Ontario jurisdiction by law, certain types of projects must involve 
an architect to ensure public health, safety, welfare, sustainable growth, and 
environmental protection. When determining if your project requires 
architectural services, hiring a qualified architect can be beneficial. Architects 
have expertise in built environments and are knowledgeable about complex 
regulatory requirements such as building codes, zoning bylaws, the construction 
process, and environmental considerations.
